## Project Overview

The Korok Seed Finder is a Python-based tool designed to enhance the gaming experience in *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*. Leveraging automation, data analysis, and project management tools, this project aims to streamline the discovery of Korok seeds by identifying optimal paths and puzzle locations. 

### Objectives:

1. Develop a Python application capable of locating Korok seed puzzles using map data and player positioning.
2. Utilize JIRA for project management, including task assignment and progress tracking.
3. Implement clustering and pathfinding algorithms to optimize seed discovery routes.
4. Analyze application scalability for features such as real-time map integration.
5. Gather user feedback to recommend future tool enhancements.

## Methodology

### Data Analysis:
- Examined publicly available Korok seed data and game mechanics.
- Developed Python scripts to parse map data and identify seed locations using logical patterns.

### Tools and Libraries:
- **Python Libraries:**
  - Pandas: Data handling and manipulation.
  - NumPy: Mathematical computations.
  - Matplotlib: Visual representation of seed locations.
- **JIRA:**
  - Tracked tasks and issues.
  - Managed sprint cycles for iterative development.
  - Leveraged reporting features for performance analysis.

### Development Workflow:
1. **Data Parsing:** Mapped predefined patterns for Korok seed locations using Python.
2. **Algorithm Integration:** Employed clustering for grouping nearby seeds and pathfinding for navigation optimization.
3. **Testing:** Verified the application’s accuracy with seed identification and user feedback.
4. **Documentation:** Recorded tasks and outcomes in JIRA, ensuring alignment with Agile practices.

### Version Control:
- **GitHub:**
  - Push/pull workflows for collaboration.
  - Issue tracking and Kanban boards for task management.
  - Dependabot for automated dependency updates.

## Conclusions and Future Work

### Achievements:
- Successfully integrated Python for game map data analysis.
- Enhanced project management using JIRA.
- Delivered a user-friendly tool for Zelda enthusiasts.

### Limitations:
1. **Real-Time Updates:**
   - The absence of live map integration limits immediate feedback.
2. **Complex Puzzles:**
   - Manual intervention is required for unique puzzle types.
3. **Scalability:**
   - Current design is limited to *Breath of the Wild* but has potential for other Zelda titles.

### Recommendations:
- **Real-Time Integration:**
  - Use real-time mapping technologies for dynamic updates.
- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Employ convolutional neural networks for puzzle recognition.
- **Scalability Enhancements:**
  - Extend compatibility to other Zelda games.
  - Leverage cloud platforms like AWS for concurrent user support.
